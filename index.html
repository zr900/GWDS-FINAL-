              <p> Making this poster helped me familiarise myself with the Adobe workspace and ImDesign, and I learned to do some basic image effects. I used contrasting colours to draw attention to the title and make it the place someone's eyes will go to first. To adhere to repetition I used the same typeface throughout. I used a thick line as a repetitive element and aligned my text along the lines to make the poster look more dynamic. I used a colour scheme of pink, purple and blue to cater to my targeted group and unify my design. </p>

          <p> AXIAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM </p>
          <p> In an axial design the elements are on an axis. I achieved this by aligning text parallel and perpendicular to the lines. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="type-group">
          <img class="type-item" src="images/TYPOGRAPHICSYSTEMS2-02.jpg" alt="My radial typographic poster.">
          <p> RADIAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM </p>
          <p> In a radial design, all of the content radiates from a central focal point. I set my text around a circle. </p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="type-group">
          <img class="type-item" src="images/TYPOGRAPHICSYSTEMS4-04.jpg" alt="My grid typographic poster.">
          <p> GRID TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM </p>
          <p> In a grid design, all the text and graphics fit neatly into columns and rows. I created this piece by using the grid tool and aligning my elements inside it. </p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="type-group">
          <img class="type-item" src="images/TYPOGRAPHICSYSTEMS5-05.jpg" alt="My bilateral typographic poster.">
          <p> BILATERAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM </p>
          <p> The text is centered and more symmetrical than the other typographic systems. I used geometric and organic shapes to balance out the regularity of the text. </p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="type-group">
          <img class="type-item" src="images/TYPOGRAPHICSYSTEMS6-06.jpg" alt="My modular typographic poster.">
          <p> MODULAR TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM </p>
          <p> A modular design is made up of mini compositions that come together to make a larger composition. The squares are a repeatable structure in my poster to hold content. </p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="type-group">
          <img class="type-item" src="images/TYPOGRAPHICSYSTEMS7-07.jpg" alt="My transitional typographic poster.">
          <p> TRANSITIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYTEM </p>
          <p> Transitional designs use layers of text that are compared to layers of sediment and stone. The text seems to have movement and direction, and I implemented this idea by arranging text so it looks like a body of water. </p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="type-group">
          <img class="type-item" src="images/TYPOGRAPHICSYSTEMS8-08.jpg" alt="My random typographic poster.">
          <p> RANDOM TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM </p>
          <p> In a random design the elements are organised randomly and it does not fit the same pattern as the other typographic systems. I implemented this by arranging my text in the shape of a star. </p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="type-group">
          <img class="type-item" src="images/TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS 009-03.jpg" alt="My dilatational typographic poster.">
          <p> DILATATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM </p>
          <p> In a dilatational design, type is set alng circular paths. I used multiple circles, varied the centers of the circles, and made them different sizes. </p>

      <h2 id="section4"> REFLECTION REPORT </h2>
      <p>This assignment is my first experience with HTML and CSS, and by building my first website I was introduced to many new concepts such as flexbox, different block level and inline elements, using class selectors, and setting up anchor links. </p>
     <p> The first thing I did was use Miro (also for the first time) to wireframe my website. I was introduced to the basic elements of a web page, including the header, footer, navigation, the body and hero image. We learned how to use AI to help with coding, and I used ChatGPT for the foundation of my webpage. I enjoyed using CSS to explore how I can style elements in different ways, and personalise my website. </p>
      <p> It was also my first experience with Github, which I found difficult to use in the beginning. I'm now fairly confident with concepts like pulling/committing/pushing, and setting up/using repositories. </p>
        
      <p>I learned about the CARP principles of design and how to implement them when designing a poster. I found contrast and repetition easier to understand and implement than proximity and alignment. </p>
        
      <p>I learned about CMYK and RGB colour, and how to export my images to use in my website. I did some research into posters made by graphic designers on Behance, and I was introduced to a few different styles. For example, I was inspired by Brutalism, which is strict and orderly, and often uses neo-grotesques. </p>
        
      <p> It was my first time using Adobe InDesign and Photoshop and there was a steep learning curve. After creating three posters, I am now familiar with creating text, shapes, and editing graphics using these tools. The CARP assignment helped me become more comfortable with the Adobe workspace but I don't think my posters showed the CARP principles particularly well. </p>
        
      <p> This semester I was also introduced to typography, and what fonts and typefaces are. It was interesting to learn that there are a vast variety of typefaces which have different styles, and can be used to convey different moods. </p>
        
      <p> We learned about the 8 typographic systems and how to create them in our posters. I made a poster for each typographic system, and this was a challenge because some of the systems can have similar features, such as grid and modular. I used Adobe Illustrator for the first time but I found it easier than InDesign and Photoshop. </p>
        
      <p> Overall, it was my first time using a variety of different tools and softwares. Before this semester, I knew nothing about design. I also feel like there is a lot more to know about InDesign and Photoshop, and I need more practise implementing the CARP principles in my work. If I had more time, I would do more research to improve my coding skills. There is still a lot I don't know about web design and after completing this assignment, I would like to explore HTML and CSS further. </p>
